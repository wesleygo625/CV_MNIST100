Computer Vision
Solo hobby project in progress

Aiming to make a program to split up and process handwritten math equations. 
Starting with neural network to identify digits (MNIST data).
Working on implementing clustering methods to split larger numbers into digits.
Working on implementing processing of math symbols (+, -, ...).
Potentially hoping to add more complicated math symbols.
