Pin Map Project
Group school project for comp-sci field session

Creating a pin map for the library that displays library assets.
Actual project we implemented in the Arthur Lakes library at Mines.
User can click their home location and it will record that entry in a database.
Map will also display maps and books related to the users home location in the library and where to find them.
Uses GIS data to display map, record map click, and determine user state or country.
