March Madness Project
Solo hobby project in progress

Goal is to create a program to help me make a March Madness bracket to win my family betting pool (don't tell them).
Implemented both a point differential prediction model (bad) and a winner model (better).
Created support to feed in bracket info and have it process all games iteratively. 
Working on analysis of results (using training data and 2023 testing data).
Hoping to test this officially March 2024.
